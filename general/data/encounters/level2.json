Though they may be found in a relaxed or even playful mood, they are subject to rapid and violent changes of temper. They often develop a fondness for one type of food, and will go out of their way to hunt that type of prey. Sometimes this taste in food runs to humans or human-like creatures.

Despite their shyness they are very inquisitive, and may follow a party just out of curiosity. They will always chase a fleeing prey."},
